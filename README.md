# Calculator-Game
Trying to create a game that tests your calculation skills
I will be attempting to create a game that can test your calculation skills
You can choose from 4 types of games:
1. 1-digit x 1-digit
2. 1-digit x 2-digit
3. 2-digit x 2-digit
4. 2-digit x 3-digit

As of now I will be starting with multiplication. Going forward, I will be looking to incorporate addition, subtraction and division also
